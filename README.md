This is a set of scripts used for papers I wrote during my PhD in FSU Jena in 2018-2021.  

The papers include: 
- __Mapping dynamical ejecta and disk masses from numerical relativity simulations of
neutron star mergers__ [2011.11110](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11110), where
we investigated the statistical properties of the BNS mergers. We compiled and
extensive dataset using all availble ejecta information from literature and
comapred the performance of various fitting formulae, and foudn that a simple
2-parameter polynomial performs reasonable good. In this study we did not do PCA
or any special type of statistical analysis. This can be done to impove the quality
of the fit.  

- __Dynamical ejecta synchrotron emission as possible contributor to the changing behaviour of GRB170817A__
[2104.04537](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04537), where we simulated the non-thermal emission from
kilonova ejecta from BNS merger simulations performed with WhiskyTHC code. We found that within
the free parameter credability range, the kilonova afterglow may explain the observed at the time
change in GRB170817A afterglow.

- __Spiral-wave wind for the blue kilonova__ [1907.04872](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04872) where we found
a new ejecta component originating from postmerger disk, after the BNS merger. The new component,
called spiral-wave wind appears to arise from dynamical instabilities withing the postmerger remnant,
the massive neutron star, and its properites include slow velocity $\sim0.2\,$c and high electron fraction
$Y_e\sim0.3$. The wind is massive and may be the ejecta component needed to explain early blue emission
in kilonova AT2017gfo, associated with gravitational-wave event GW170817.

- __Numerical Relativity Simulations of the Neutron Star Merger GW170817: Long-Term Remnant Evolutions, Winds, Remnant Disks,
and Nucleosynthesis__ [2008.04333](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04333) where we investigated the postmerger remnant, ejecta,
nucleosythesis and kilonova using a large $\sim30$ ab-initio numerical relativity simulations. We
found the spiral-wave wind in most of the simulations with long-lived remnant and found that its mass flux
is correlated with the amplitude of the $m_1$ one-armed instability in the remnant.
